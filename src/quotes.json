The position of cards in a new deck are typically identical, so that means if you take out the jokers and draw the card at the very bottom, it's the ace of spades almost 100% of the time. Oh that's right! I didn't say a word about it being a new deck. Rather, you didn't ask. Being in the \"no\" gives you the power to turn the probability of winning from 1.92% to 100%. The more knowledge of a party will be the inevitable victor."
